# ChatGPT with Branching

This project implements branching conversations with OpenAI's ChatGPT API. Users can explore non-linear digressions without interrupting the main conversational flow. Each conversation node maintains a history traceable back to the root interaction, enabling structured exploration of different conversational paths.
* Branches can be added to any non-leaf conversation node.
* Leaf nodes are simply continued, at which point they would support a branch.
* A non-leaf node can support one or more branches.

## Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository, add your ChatGPT API key to the html file (search for 'API_KEY'), and then open the file in your browser.
